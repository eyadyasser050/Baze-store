/**
 * paymob-integration.md (SERVER SIDE)
 *
 * This file is a placeholder with instructions â€” do NOT include secret keys client-side.
 *
 * Steps to integrate Paymob (short version):
 * 1. Create Paymob merchant account at https://paymob.com/ and get API key (test first).
 * 2. Implement a server endpoint that:
 *    - Authenticates with Paymob using your API key to request an auth token.
 *    - Creates an order / payment reference and requests the iframe or payment key.
 *    - Returns the payment URL/token to the client which opens Paymob payment page/iframe.
 *
 * Example flow (node/express outline):
 *
 * POST /api/create-payment
 *  - receive cart details, amount, customer info
 *  - request auth token: POST https://accept.paymobsolutions.com/api/auth/tokens {api_key}
 *  - register order: POST /ecommerce/orders with token
 *  - request payment key: POST /acceptance/payment_keys with order info
 *  - respond with iframe_url (or payment token) to client
